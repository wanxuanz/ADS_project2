## Project Summary

**Mandatory task**<br />
Develop an algorithm that determines the optimal charge and discharge behaviour of a battery based in Victoria. <br />
Maximise revenues by charging when electricity prices are low and discharging when prices are high. <br />

**Bonus task**<br />
Inform current charging behaviour without using future prices. <br />

**Industry purpose: Revenue maximisation for...**<br />
•Stand-alone grid batteries <br />
•Residential battery aggregators (Virtual Power Plants) <br />
•Renewable energy developers <br />
